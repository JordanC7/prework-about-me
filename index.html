      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a software developer in training</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>All over - Texas, Kansas, Arizona, California (No I wasn't an army brat, more like a gypsy)</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love singing, playing with my 8yo daughter and 2 dogs, and watching crass television shows like The Mick or Family Guy</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>One where I have respect from others and don't work with mentally ill criminals all day</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Overland Park near Stoll Park</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>My daughter's dad is actually a programmer and I learned a lot from him. Criminal justice has a fast burn out rate, and I hit that about a year ago! I'm ready to start a new challenge in my life! </p>
